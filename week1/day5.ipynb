      "\n",
      "📘 DeepMath-103K\n",
      "\n",
      "A meticulously curated dataset of over 100K advanced math problems, each with verified answers, difficulty ratings, and multiple reasoning paths.\n",
      "\n",
      "It supports both supervised and reinforcement learning (RL), and has already enabled new SOTA results (85.5% on MATH 500 using a 7B model).\n",
      "\n",
      "Great for training models that reason through complex, multi-step calculations — and for evaluating them fairly, thanks to careful decontamination.\n",

      "\n",
      "Built to train InternVL2 with Mixed Preference Optimization (MPO), it significantly improves performance on MathVista and other VQA benchmarks — and reduces hallucinations along the way.\n",

      "Each example includes <think> tags, domain labels, and LLM-based verification to ensure the chains reflect genuine reasoning (not result summaries).\n",
